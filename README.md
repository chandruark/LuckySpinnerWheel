# LuckySpinnerWheel
used for my own concern..change according to your wish

its a simple object Animator type...
use your own image for the animation...
to place a degree calculation  in    *Mainactivity.java*   it is tough to understand,,, i will try to explain


in this image...has 10 sectors.
total spin wheel degree= 360.
for each sector it is=360/10  => 36 degree.
for example, its not a actual content
consider first,sector as position (5) in my wheel image its starts from half the sector as 36 degree
that means 36/2=18 degree.
so i keep my *factor* as 18 degree and i increasing by the real numbers upto 10 for my sectors to complete.
only 0 degree is little different, it starts from 360 degree (-) factor and ends with 0 degree (+) factor.

kindly, make sure about setting the degree correctly....
